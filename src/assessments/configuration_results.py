"""What a configuration query page SHOWS, once the query has chosen the rows.

One entry per object, keyed on the search registry's model label. The compiler already answers
"which rows match"; this answers "what does a row look like", which is the only part that cannot
be derived - a queryset knows its fields but not which five of them a person wants to read.

Columns are chosen to be the ones a QUERY is usually about, which is not the same set the
findings tabs show. There is no Findings column and no Collected column: this surface answers
"which objects look like this", and a finding count on the row would invite the reader to treat
it as the findings tab, which is a page away and says something else.

Kept apart from `configuration_navigation.py` on purpose. That module is imported by `app_meta`
during project composition, before the app registry is ready, so it must not reach a model. This
one is imported by the view, at request time, and reaches models freely.

Adding an object is an entry here plus `search_model` on its `ConfigObject`. Both, or neither:
navigation gates the query view on `search_model`, and a label with no entry here would render a
table with no columns, which reads as "nothing matched" rather than as "not built".
